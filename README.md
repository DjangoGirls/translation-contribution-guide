Translation Guide
=======

More and more people are contacting Django Girls asking how they can translate the tutorial into their native language.

If you are one of these people, we would like to thank you first! We need people like you, you are amazing!

We wrote down how we deal with translations to demystify the process a bit. It is not perfect and we still struggle to make it manageable, so if you - after reading this guide - have any tips or ideas you would like to share with us: let us know!

Ok, let's begin then.

Crowdin
-------

Django Girls Tutorial's translations are hosted on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/django-girls-tutorial).

If you want to join an existing translation team or launch a new translation, [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).

To be published, a translation needs to be validated by a proofreader. If you don't know if a proofreader is on your team or if you want to be one, send us an [email](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).
