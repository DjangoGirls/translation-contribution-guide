# Crowdin

We use Crowdin for translating the Django Girls tutorial.

Go to our [Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/django-girls-tutorial) and have a look if the language you want to translate the tutorial into is already listed. If so, all you need to do is to create a free account on Crowdin and start contributing.

If the language you want to help with is missing, you can tell us so by:

* writing to us at hello@djangogirls.org or
* creating a GitHub issue in the repository for our [tutorial](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial/issues/).

We will let you know as soon as we have added the language to our Crowdin page. Once that has happened, you can start translating, yay!
