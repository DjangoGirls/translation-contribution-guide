# Translation guidelines

There are some points we would like you to keep in mind when writing translation.

### Friendly, cheerful and positive language

Django Girls Tutorial is not your ordinary tutorial. We put a lot of work into making sure the words we use are always friendly, cheerful and positive. We make sure that person reading the tutorial feels awesome about themselves. We're not super-duper serious, because there is absolutely no reason to be.

Keep this in mind while translating a tutorial. Imagine that you're talking about all of this things to your friend -- this helps to find the right words.

### Pronouns and gender specific words

We would all like to live in a world when words that does not imply gender exist. We strive for using a not gendered language in our tutorial, however, it's not possible in all languages.

- If you face a decision which pronoun or gendered word to use, please default to female pronoun: she/her.

- If the language you are translating tutorial into has female version of a word "programmer", and the genderless version doesn't exist, we'd prefer to use a female version.

- If you see that other translators used different pronouns / words, feel free to correct them!

We know it isn't perfect solution, but at the end, this is a tutorial used at workshop attended mostly by women and we want to make them comfortable.

### Consistent wording

It would be great to use consistent wording across the whole tutorial. If there are a couple of people working on the translation, make sure that you use names consistently. It could be confusing if you use one word for console in one chapter and use totally different name in next one, right?

Sit down together and agree on what technical words you should or should not translate.

### Translating code examples

Generally we do not do this. Let's leave the code as it is. One exception could be strings and texts in templates. But Python and Django code should stay as it is.
