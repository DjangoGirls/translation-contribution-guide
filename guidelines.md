# Translation Guidelines

There are some points we would like you to keep in mind when writing translation.

* If the language you are translating tutorial into has female version of a word "programmer", we'd prefer to use it.
* If the language has a specific female/male pronouns, we would also prefer to use female ones.
* If you see that other translators used different pronouns / words, feel free to correct them!

Other than that, it would be great to use consistent wording. If there are a couple of people working on the translation, make sure that you use names consistently. It could be confusing if you use one word for console in one chapter and use totally different name in next one, right?

Translating code examples
----------

Generally we do not do this. Let's leave the code as it is. One exception could be strings and texts in templates. But Python and Django code should stay as it is.
