============

Please write down the names of the people involved in the translation process. Ideally, there should be two people for each language, at least one of whom should be a girl. The **ambassador** is responsible for the initial translation (or coordinating the translation with a group of people). After the ambassador submits a translation, the **proofreader** reviews it. The proofreader makes sure that the translation maintains a cheerful tone and consistent language from chapter to chapter and that any gender-related words or phrases are handled in the way we've outlined in the translation guidelines.
